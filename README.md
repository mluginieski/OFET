# About
The idea of OFET package is to provide simple codes for the most common curves and calculations in OFETs world. Feel free to download it and change it. All programs were developed with Python 3.8.

# Programs
For now, two programs are avaliable: out-trans_OFET.py and SCLC.py. The first one is responsible for the calculations of the output curves and transfer characteristic curves of OFETs. The second one calculates the current of the Space-charged limeted current model for organic semiconductors.

# Examples
